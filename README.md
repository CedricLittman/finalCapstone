This is a Python file that monitors the status of tasks and allows the status to updated and new ones to be added. It is password protected and allows users to make and change certain records and allows admin only to make certain changes. It records certain reports to disk for later retreival.

If the file has not been used before these are admin and password respectively. Once the user has succesfully logged in they will be freeted with a set of choices, as follows:
